# Titanic competition for Kaggle

This is my submission for my first Kaggle ML competition. Predict the survivors on the Titanic.

## Short explanation
As a model I used the [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), which is a decision tree algorithm. As features I used the following data:
1. In which class a passenger was
2. Male/female
3. Whether and how many siblings/spouses were on board
4. Whether and how many parents/children were on board

My goal was more to understand Machine Learning and scikit-learn than to actually compete.

## Libraries used
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
